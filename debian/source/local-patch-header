Subject: Collected Debian patches for whatpulse
Author: Oxan van Leeuwen <oxan@oxanvanleeuwen.nl>

The whatpulse package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches isn't worth 
the effort.  They are therefore all included in this single Debian
patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository. The location of the repository can be found in the Vcs-Git
field in debian/control.

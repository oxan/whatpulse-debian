Template: whatpulse/users-in-input-group
Type: string
Description: Users that will be granted access to track input events:
 WhatPulse reads the pressed keys and clicks directly from the appropriate 
 kernel interface, the /dev/input/event devices. However, by default regular
 user accounts aren't allowed to use this interface, since all keypresses and
 mouse movements on the computer can be intercepted using this interface.
 .
 For WhatPulse to work, the permissions on this interface need to be changed. 
 The installer can automatically create a new group named 'input', grant that
 group access to the interface and add some users to it. This results in 
 slightly degrated security, since all applications started by these users can 
 then intercept all keypresses, but is required for WhatPulse to function.
 .
 Enter the users that should be added to this group in a space-separated list. 
 Usually, you should list at least your own username here. If you don't want
 the installer to automatically setup permissions, leave this field empty. In
 that case, you will need to manually configure permissions before you can use
 WhatPulse.

Template: whatpulse/allow-network-sniffing
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you want to allow WhatPulse to intercept all network traffic?
 WhatPulse can track your bandwidth usage. For this to function, WhatPulse
 needs to be granted permission to intercept all network traffic on this
 computer, including sensitive data such as passwords.
 .
 If you accept this, only WhatPulse will be allowed to intercept all network
 traffic from this computers. If you don't accept this, no permissions will be
 granted. WhatPulse will still function, but bandwidth tracking won't be 
 available.
